Your mission is to slay a target in a long abandoned church.

[[Jaquile Sabathorn]] the target, has been in the church for some time now.

The adventures meet after sharing a duped quest and are now forced to work together.

[[Jaquile Sabathorn]] the priest and his pet minitour Randy inhabit the church and the party fought.

After winning we find the [[Talon Kingdom]] sent a [[Serge]](Centaur) and a [[Elf Lady|Elf Lady]] to meet with us after our fight. 
> [!NOTE]
> Never got the Elf Ladys Name. I think she was a officer in their army?

We take a carriage 8 miles into the kingdom. The scenery is beautiful and fresh compared to the dark dingy Church. The kingdom appears very rich and wealthy. Dawning a very large castle and the people seem free and happy. 

The Queen's name is [[Hatsune Miku]](Elf). She is well beloved. The reason behind the "test" is that Miku the Queen is missing.  ^250787
> [!NOTE]
> This could be the reason the kingdom seems to be in desperate need of help. Seeming to need to outsource work to Adventurers. 

She has been missing for a couple of days and the public doesn't know. We need to send nobody's so the kingdom doesn't find out and the kidnappers don't get suspicious. 

The night we found the queen missing the note read " If you want to see your beloved queen again, you have to find different puzzle's and mysteries in different locations.  I will send instructions for each puzzle." On the back it shows a depiction of Gears and Metal. ^6b6bfe

50 Gp now to prepare and 5000 Pp upon the queens arrival.
We can stay at the castle for free and will get a free carriage. 

We spend some money in town and got gear to prepare.

> [!NOTE]
> Ran a history check on the emblem on the back of the note and I remember the visual of the kingdom. The name comes back, The Bastion Kingdom.

It is now late noon.
It is also Autumn 

Bastion Kingdom is 35 miles and 2 days journey
